                        <p>During a recent review of the Sader rankings, several accounts suspected of using stat cheats were identified. After a full inspection of our internal database, we discovered around 20 suspicious characters across two Explorer Clubs.</p>
                        <ul>
                        <li><strong>Explorer Club Names:</strong> fakyyes, MdmMurangal</li>
                        <li>Recurring naming patterns were observed across characters in these clubs, strongly suggesting they may be operated by the same individual.</li>
                        <li><strong>Examples from fakyyes:</strong> BakaWolf, BakaFish, BakaViki …</li>
                        <li><strong>Examples from MdmMurangal:</strong> BakaKiller, BakaName, BakaRed …</li>
                        <li>Relevant data has already been submitted to Neople, and further actions may follow.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>DFOGANG will continue to conduct regular inspections of our database to detect and report accounts suspected of using cheats. Thank you.</p>

                        <p>Our ultimate goal is to provide comprehensive damage charts, similar to those found on dundam or dfmax.</p>
                        <p>To achieve this, we are completely overhauling our existing system and designing a new architecture from the ground up. Once this new system is in place, character searches will no longer rely solely on cached data—instead, you’ll be able to retrieve up-to-date information directly from the servers in real time. We also expect a significant improvement in site loading speeds as a result.</p>
                        <p>However, please note that due to the inconsistent and unintuitive nature of the DFO API responses, this process is taking a bit longer than expected. We appreciate your patience and understanding as we work towards these improvements!</p>
